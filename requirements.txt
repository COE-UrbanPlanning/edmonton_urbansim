# to install:
# 1) get anaconda 3 and install
# 2) clone this repo
# 3) conda install git
# 4) pip install -r requirements.txt
# 5) conda config --add channels conda-forge
# 6) conda install gdal
# 7) conda install fiona
# 8) conda install geopandas 
# 9) conda config --add channels udst
# 10) conda install pandana
# 11) conda install urbansim // to solve cannot find utils
# run by calling `python baus.py &`
#
# NOTE: Of steps 6, 7, and 8, you might only have to do step 8.
#       If you get any errors after doing just step 8, try steps 6 and 7.
#       Problems seem to come up because some versions of conda seem to install 
#       a version of libgdal that doesn't match the version of gdal and/or fiona
#       that are installed with geopandas, causing geopandas to not work.
#       If you're having troubles, try using the "conda list" command to see 
#       what versions of gdal, libgdal, and fiona you have installed. If you have a 
#       version of conda that installs libgdal, make sure its version number is 
#       similar to the version number of gdal. Some versions don't seem to install 
#       libgdal at all and work just fine.
