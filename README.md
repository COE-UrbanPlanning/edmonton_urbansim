### Installation Instructions
To install (as shown in requirements.txt):
1) get anaconda 3.6 and install
2) clone this repo
3) conda install git
4) pip install -r requirements.txt
5) conda config --add channels conda-forge
6) conda install gdal
7) conda install fiona
8) conda install geopandas 
9) conda config --add channels udst
10) conda install pandana
11) conda install urbansim // to solve cannot find utils
run by calling `python baus.py &`

NOTE: Of steps 6, 7, and 8, you might only have to do step 8.
      If you get any errors after doing just step 8, try steps 6 and 7.
      Problems seem to come up because some versions of conda seem to install 
      a version of libgdal that doesn't match the version of gdal and/or fiona
      that are installed with geopandas, causing geopandas to not work.
      If you're having troubles, try using the "conda list" command to see 
      what versions of gdal, libgdal, and fiona you have installed. If you have a 
      version of conda that installs libgdal, make sure its version number is 
      similar to the version number of gdal. Some versions don't seem to install 
      libgdal at all and work just fine. 
      
### User Interface
To use the user interface, open a command prompt and navigate to the GUI folder in this repo. Enter UI.bat to run the user interface. From it, you can select any of the output shapefiles from the run folder to visualize.

DRAFT Bay Area UrbanSim (BAUS) Implementation
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UDST/bayarea_urbansim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UDST/bayarea_urbansim)

This is the DRAFT UrbanSim implementation for the Bay Area. Policy documentation for the Bay Area model is available [here](http://data.mtc.ca.gov/bayarea_urbansim/) and documentation for the UrbanSim framework is available [here](https://udst.github.io/urbansim/).

* Install Python for your OS ([Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) highly suggested)
* Clone this repository
* Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Get data using `python baus.py -c --mode fetch_data` (you will need an appropriately configured AWS credentials file which you must get from your MTC contact)
* Preprocess data using `python baus.py -c --mode preprocessing`
* Run a simulation using `python baus.py -c` (default mode is simulation)

### An overview of baus.py
 
baus.py is a command line interface (cli) used to run Bay Area UrbanSim in various modes.  These modes currently include:

* estimation, which runs a series of models to save parameter estimates for all statistical models
* simulation, which runs all models to create a simulated regional growth forecast
* fetch_data, which downloads large data files from Amazon S3 as inputs for BAUS
* preprocessing, which performas long-running data cleaning steps and writes newly cleaned data back to the binary h5 file for use in the other steps
* baseyearsim which runs a "base year simulation" which summarizes the data before the simulation runs (during simulation, summaries are written after each year, so the first year's summaries are *after* the base year is finished - a base year simulation writes the summaries before any models have run)

### Urban Analytics Lab (UAL) Improvements

#### Data schemas

* Builds out the representation of individual housing units to include a semi-persistent tenure status, which is assigned based on characteristics of initial unit occupants
* Joins additional race/ethnicity PUMS variables to synthetic households [NB: currently missing from the reconciled model, but will be re-added]
* Adds a representation of market rents alongside market sale prices

#### Model steps

* Residential hedonics predict market rents and sale prices separately, with rents estimated from Craigslist listings
* Household move-out choice is conditional on tenure status
* Household location choice is modeled separately for renters and owners, and includes race/ethnicity measures as explanatory variables
* Developer models are updated to produce both rental and ownership housing stock

Notebooks, work history, code samples, etc are kept in a separate [bayarea_urbansim_work](https://github.com/ual/bayarea_urbansim_work) repository. 

#### Current status (August 2016)

* All of the UAL alterations have been refactored as modular orca steps
* This code is contained in `baus/ual.py`, `configs/ual_settings.yaml` and individual `yaml` files as needed for regression models that have been re-estimated
* There are *no* changes to `urbansim`, `urbansim_defaults`, or MTC's orca initialization and model steps
* MTC and UAL model steps can be mixed and matched by passing different lists to orca; see `run.py` for examples
* The UAL model steps document and test for required data characteristics, using the [orca_test](https://github.com/udst/orca_test) library

### Outputs from Simulation (written to the runs directory)

ALL OUTPUT IN THIS DIRECTORY IS NOT OFFICIAL OUTPUT. PLEASE CONTACT MTC FOR OFFICIAL OUTPUTS OF THE LAST PLAN BAY AREA.

`[num]` = a positive integer used to identify each successive run.  This number usually starts at 1 and increments each time baus.py is called.

Many files are output to the `runs/` directory. They are described below.

filename |description
----------------------------|-----------
run[num]\_topsheet\_[year].csv | An overall summary of various housing and employment outcomes summarized by very coarse geographies.
run[num]_parcel_output.csv 		| A csv of all new built space in the region.  This has a few thousand rows and dozens of columns which contain various inputs and outputs, as well as debugging information which helps explain why each development was picked by UrbanSim.
run[num]\_parcel_data\_[year].csv 			|A CSV with parcel level output for *all* parcels with lat, lng and includes change in total_residential_units and change in total_job_spaces, as well as zoned capacity measures.
run[num]\_building_data\_[year].csv 			|The same as above but for buildings.
run[num]\_taz\_summarie\s_[year].csv 			|A CSV for [input to the MTC travel model](http://analytics.mtc.ca.gov/foswiki/UrbanSimTwo/OutputToTravelModel)
run[num]\_pda_summaries\_[year].csv, run[num]\_juris_summaries\_[year].csv, run[num]\_superdistrict_summaries\_[year].csv | Similar outputs to the taz summaries but for each of these geographies.  Used for understanding the UrbanSim forecast at an aggregate level.
run[runnum]_dropped_buildings.csv     | A summary of buildings which were redeveloped during the simulated forecast.
run[runnum]_simulation_output.json | Used by the web output viewer.


### Directory structure

* baus/ contains all the Python code which runs the BAUS model.
* data/ contains BAUS inputs which are small enough to store and render in GitHub (large files are stored on Amazon S3) - this also contains lots of scenario inputs in the form of csv files.  See the readme in the data directory for detailed docs on each file.
* configs/ contains the model configuration files used by UrbanSim.  This also contains settings.yaml which provides simulation inputs and settings in a non-tabular form. 
* scripts/ these are one-off scripts which are used to perform various input munging and output analysis tasks.  See the docs in that directory for more information.
